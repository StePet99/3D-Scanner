# 3D Scanner using Raspberry Pi Camera and COLMAP

## Overview

This project is a 3D scanner using the Raspberry Pi Camera and a stepper motor for rotation. The images taken during the scan are used for 3D reconstruction through COLMAP, a photogrammetry software. This setup is designed to capture images, process them, and create a 3D model of the scanned object.

## Features

- Capture a set of images using the Raspberry Pi Camera.
- Rotate the object for full 360-degree scanning with a stepper motor.
- Organize the captured images in a project folder.
- Perform 3D reconstruction using COLMAP to create a 3D mesh.

## Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi 4** or any Raspberry Pi model with camera support.
- **Raspberry Pi Camera** (either V1, V2, or HQ model).
- **Stepper Motor** with a stepper motor driver.
- **Ubuntu** operating system (recommended for better package management and ease of installation).
- **Python 3** (with pip) and the necessary libraries.
- **COLMAP** (installed on the Raspberry Pi) for 3D reconstruction.

## Hardware Setup

- **Stepper Motor**:
  - Connect the stepper motor to GPIO pins (typically 4 pins for a 4-wire stepper motor).
  
- **Raspberry Pi Camera**:
  - Connect the Raspberry Pi Camera to the dedicated camera interface on the Raspberry Pi.
  
- **LEDs**:
  - Optional, for feedback and indicating the scanning process status.
  
- **Buttons**:
  - Used to control the number of images to capture and start the scanning process.

## Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have the following installed on your Raspberry Pi:

- **Python3** and **pip**:
  ```
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
  ```

- **Raspberry Pi Camera Library** (for camera management):
  ```
  sudo apt install python3-picamera
  ```

- **COLMAP** for 3D reconstruction:
  You will need to follow the instructions for installing COLMAP on your Raspberry Pi (refer to [COLMAP's GitHub](https://github.com/colmap/colmap) for installation instructions).

### 2. Install Python Libraries

For the Python script that interacts with the hardware and COLMAP, install the necessary dependencies:

```
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
```

### 3. Set Up COLMAP

Install COLMAP on your Raspberry Pi following the official guide. Once installed, COLMAP will be used for 3D reconstruction.

You will need to have **SQLite3** and **FLANN** installed for COLMAP to work. Run the following commands to install the dependencies:

```
sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev libflann-dev
```

### 4. Enable Camera Interface

Run the following command to enable the camera interface on Raspberry Pi:

```
sudo raspi-config
```

Select **Interfacing Options** > **Camera** and enable it. Then, reboot the Raspberry Pi.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your Raspberry Pi.
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-scanner.git
   cd 3d-scanner
   ```

2. Run the Python script to start the scanning process:

   ```
   python3 scanner.py
   ```

3. The script will prompt you to enter the project name. This name will be used to create a folder where all captured images will be stored.

4. The stepper motor will rotate the object and take images at each step. The images will be stored in a folder with the project name.

5. After all images are taken, COLMAP will be used to reconstruct the 3D model.

## Example Flow

1. **Enter Project Name**: `MyFirstScan`
2. **Capture Images**: The script rotates the object and captures images.
3. **3D Reconstruction**: COLMAP processes the captured images and outputs a 3D model.

## Troubleshooting

- If COLMAP does not run as expected, make sure all dependencies (e.g., SQLite3, FLANN, and CGAL) are properly installed.
- Ensure that the Raspberry Pi Camera is enabled and connected properly.
- Check that the stepper motor is wired correctly and the GPIO pins are configured as expected.
